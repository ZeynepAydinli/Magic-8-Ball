# Magic-8-Ball

I would be happy to receive a certificate of participation for the "Software 101" training organized in cooperation with Microfon, Workintech and Akbank.
During the training, a Magic 8-Ball project was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
You can access my Magic 8-Ball project, which I learned from the training, link I mentioned below.
